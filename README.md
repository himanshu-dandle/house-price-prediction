# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains various features describing different aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, and the goal is to predict the final sale price for each house.

The project consists of two main steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean and preprocess the data.
2. Model Training to build a machine learning model and make predictions on the test data.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains 79 features describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
- You can find the dataset on [Kaggle: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
